## Setup

I currently run [Arch Linux] with [i3] on my laptop and desktop and use
- [lemurs] as my display/login manager
- [polybar] as my bar with a few custom modules
- [Firefox Developer Edition] as my web browser
- [dlauncher] as my program launcher
- [Neovim] as my text editor
- [Alacritty] as terminal emulator with [tmux], using [fish] as my shell

Most of my configurations can be found in this repository.
