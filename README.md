## Setup

I currently run [Arch Linux] with [sway] on my computers and use:
- [waybar] as my bar with a few custom modules
- [Firefox Developer Edition] as my web browser
- [fuzzel] as my application launcher
- [Neovim] as my text editor
- [Alacritty] as terminal emulator with [tmux], using [fish] as my shell

Most of my configurations can be found in this repository.
